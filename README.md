# statistical-work

Things to consider working on and adding: (1) ising model mcmc/gibbs sampler, (2) EM algorithm for mixture model, (3) HMM example where parameters are unknown, (4) graph colorings or disc packing, (5) maybe just a regular gibbs sampler problem/example

This repository contains code and visuals from my research at the Miri Lab, as well as other statistical projects I work on in my free time.
