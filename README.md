# statistical-work

Things to consider working on and adding: (1) ising model mcmc/gibbs sampler, (2) EM algorithm for mixture model, (3) HMM example where parameters are unknown, (4) graph colorings or disc packing, (5) maybe just a regular gibbs sampler problem/example

More to add: maybe add some of the math you have worked on, specifically with Ursula and with Christian, regarding rates of convergence for Markov chains as well as some basic ergodic theory and your project on the doubling map. 

This repository contains code and visuals from my research at the Miri Lab, as well as other statistical projects I work on in my free time.
